Task 1:
Q1:The get methods are used for reading the private private fields name and yearBuilt. Any property without a get method is considered write only. Since we will want to know the name and the yearBuilt of the vessels, it is right to 
use the get() method. The body of the get method must return a value of the property type.

Q2: Every object in C# has a ToString method returning a string representation of the object. Overriding the ToString method helps present a default represenatation of the object. If the ToString method is not overridden, 
then the default implementation will return your object name as : Namespace.ClassName
